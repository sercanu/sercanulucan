<dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases" target="_blank">Ultimate List of Cognitive biases</a><br /></dt>
<dd>Each item of the list is a must read. Explains our behaviours&rsquo; reasons.</dd>
<dt>From ‘The 10X Rule’ by Grant Cardone</dt>
<dd>Until you become completely obsessed with your mission, no one will take you seriously. Until the world understands that you’re not going away — that you are 100 percent committed and have complete and utter conviction and will persist in pursuing your project — you will not get the attention you need and the support you want.<br /></dd>
<dt>From ‘Influence’, by Robert Cialdini<br /></dt>
<dd>One of the most powerful forms of influence is the rule of reciprocation. The rule states that people often try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided for them.
The example of a simple mail appeal for donations produces a response rate of around 18 percent. But when the mailing also includes an unsolicited gift (with gummed, individualised address labels), the success rate nearly doubles to 35 percent.</dd>
