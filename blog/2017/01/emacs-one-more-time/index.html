<p>Last year, I decided to use Emacs for Clojure development. It is the most common, mature and the richest development environment for this task. After downloading and installation, I got a clean setup.</p>

<p>I read documents, followed the tutorials. I started to understand the terminology and the shortcuts. Window, frame, buffer, modes&hellip; Nothing was working according to my intuitions, but I didn&rsquo;t step back and kept practicing on.</p>

<p>I watched videos, read the guide at <a href="http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/" target="_blank">braveclojure.com</a>, read more documents and started customizations. However, things were not easy, configuration was hard. I was obsessed to build the dream environment for Clojure development, but I was fighting against the editor. Anyway, I believe the motto <strong>&ldquo;No pain, No gain&rdquo;</strong> in heart.</p>

<h3 id="oh-distributions">Oh, Distributions!</h3>

<p>While I was reading about the configurations, I saw references to some distributions. <a href="http://spacemacs.org/" target="_blank">Spacemacs</a> and <a href="http://batsov.com/prelude/" target="_blank">Prelude</a> were the ready made configurations that I was trying do. Please have a look at them if you&rsquo;re new to Emacs. I <strong>choose Spacemacs</strong>, it was more popular and it looked really cool.</p>

<p>After reading Spacemacs documentation, I began to customize it. It wasn&rsquo;t hard but you need to be ready for surprises. For example, if you wan&rsquo;t to change the font-size, you just edit the configuration file and reload it. (with a key combination) Oops&hellip; nothing happened. Why? Because the default font <strong>isn&rsquo;t supported</strong> at 16px. I&rsquo;m using a Mac and I didn&rsquo;t expect this. Anyway, I changed the font to Menlo and it worked.</p>

<p>I was very serious to grasp the best practices. Every documentation or tutorial was referencing to <a href="http://orgmode.org/" target="_blank">Org mode</a>. It seemed worthy to learn, I read a lot, I really tried to use it while taking notes, planning or even generating a static website, but I didn&rsquo;t like it. Maybe it was <strong>my fault</strong> to get busy with irrelevant things. I should have focused to <a href="https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider" target="_blank">Cider</a> and Clojure things.</p>

<h3 id="yes-pain-no-gain">Yes Pain, No Gain</h3>

<p>Keybindings were nightmare. I could never configured them in a right way. I couldn&rsquo;t use slurp and barf shortcuts of <a href="http://danmidwood.com/content/2014/11/21/animated-paredit.html" target="_blank">Paredit</a>. Maybe this wasn&rsquo;t so important, but I was obsessed.</p>

<p>Switching between windows wasn&rsquo;t easy. I lost the REPL window many times. Any wrong command was ruining current setup heavily. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to take back my faulty commands. I was hiding something forever or falling in a hopeless situation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very used to see the project folder at the left side of the window. So, I searched for a package and found <a href="https://github.com/jaypei/emacs-neotree" target="_blank">NeoTree</a>. After many attempts of getting used to shortcuts, I was happy to see my files at the left sidebar, until opening a new project. NeoTree was working only for one frame, it was a <strong>single instance</strong>. It wasn&rsquo;t possible to work at more than one project at the same time.</p>

<p>All these experiments took several evenings and several weekends. I wasn&rsquo;t learning Clojure, I was struggling with Emacs all the time, and I stopped.</p>

<h3 id="one-more-time">One More Time</h3>

<p>Today, I decided to try one more time. This time I&rsquo;m experienced and I&rsquo;m focused to write a single Clojure function. I installed the latest version of Emacs, renamed my .emacs.d folder and .spacemacs file. I started from scratch to build a new setup. I cloned the Spacemacs repo, add Clojure to modes and barely open a Clojure project. I started editing the file and wrote my first <code>defn</code> Oops&hellip;, <strong>I couldn&rsquo;t type square brackets</strong> with Alt+8. I received &ldquo;No window numbered 8&rdquo;. Huh&hellip; very disappointing.</p>

<p>Okay, many people are comfortable at using Emacs. This means <strong>it&rsquo;s my problem</strong> but I really don&rsquo;t know what is the wrong with me :) I don&rsquo;t get how it works for others.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/jasongilman/proto-repl" target="_blank">Proto REPL</a> now. It has some problems but it&rsquo;s easy. Also Cursive is an option too, but I think it should be simplified and work as an independent IDE.</p>
